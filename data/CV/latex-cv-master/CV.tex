\section*{About this template}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This document is modelled after the style of
\href{https://bastian.rieck.me}{my} own CV, which you can find
\href{https://bastian.rieck.me/about/cv.pdf}{here}. It was originally
inspired by the CV of \href{http://nitens.org/taraborelli/cvtex}{Dario
Taraborelli}, but has since somewhat evolved---or so I like to tell
myself---from the original template.\\

This document does not offer many special features, except for the
\verb|\years| macro, which can be used to typeset small notes in the
margin of the document. I use them to indicate \emph{durations}, but you
could also repurpose it to have small annotations in the style of Edward
Tufte. In addition, the template uses two special fonts for sans-serif
typesetting and monospace typesetting. I do not tend to use the former
for many things, but you might like it for typesetting the titles of
publications. The latter font type, though, I often use in order to
describe software projects or packages, such as \texttt{PyTorch} or
\texttt{scikit-learn}.\\

That's all there is to it---enjoy the template \& feel free to open
tickets for comments or feedback.
