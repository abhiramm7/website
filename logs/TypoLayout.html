  <p>Example of quoted text:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>

  <h2 id="sidenotes">Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes</h2>
  <p>One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.<span class="sidenote">This is a sidenote.</span> Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.</p>
  <p>Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related but not necessary information such as asides or citations <em>as close as possible</em> to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of ideas in the main text.</p>
  <p>Sidenotes consist of two elements: a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and a sidenote with content. To add the former, just put a label and dummy checkbox into the text where you want the reference to go, like so:</p>
  <pre><code>&lt;label for=&quot;sn-demo&quot;
         class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;
         id=&quot;sn-demo&quot;
         class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>You must manually assign a reference <code>id</code> to each side or margin note, replacing “sn-demo” in the <code>for</code> and the <code>id</code> attribute values with an appropriate descriptor. It is useful to use prefixes like <code>sn-</code> for sidenotes and <code>mn-</code> for margin notes.</p>
  <p>Immediately adjacent to that sidenote reference in the main text goes the sidenote content itself, in a <code>span</code> with class <code>sidenote</code>. This tag is also inserted directly in the middle of the body text, but is either pushed into the margin or hidden by default. Make sure to position your sidenotes correctly by keeping the sidenote-number label close to the sidenote itself.</p>
  <p>If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings, then you want a margin note. ⊕ <span class="marginnote">This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.</span> On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a margin note to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. This document currently uses the symbol ⊕ (<code>&amp;#8853;</code>), but it’s up to you.</p>
  <p>Margin notes are created just like sidenotes, but with the <code>marginnote</code> class for the content and the <code>margin-toggle</code> class for the label and dummy checkbox. For instance, here is the code for the margin note used in the previous paragraph:</p>
  <pre><code>&lt;label for=&quot;mn-demo&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-demo&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;
    This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
  &lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>Figures in the margin are created as margin notes, as demonstrated in the next section. :::</p>
  <h2 id="figures">Figures</h2>
  <p>Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text. Data, graphs, and figures are kept with the text that discusses them. In print, this means they are not relegated to a separate page. On the web, that means readability of graphics and their accompanying text without extra clicks, tab-switching, or scrolling.</p>
  <p>Figures should try to use the <code>figure</code> element, which by default are constrained to the main column. Don’t wrap figures in a paragraph tag. Any label or margin note goes in a regular margin note inside the figure. For example, most of the time one should introduce a figure directly into the main flow of discussion, like so:</p>
  <p><img src="img/exports-imports.png" /></p>
  <p>⊕<span class="marginnote"><img src="img/rhino.png" alt="Image of a Rhinoceros" />F.J. Cole, “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in Zooological Literature,” <em>Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice</em> (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s <em>Visual Explanations</em>.</span> But tight integration of graphics with text is central to Tufte’s work even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a text. In many of those cases, a margin figure may be most appropriate. To place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a <code>p</code> tag, as seen to the right of this paragraph.</p>
  <p>If you need a full-width figure, give it the <code>fullwidth</code> class. Make sure that’s inside an <code>article</code>, and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen. This approach is demonstrated below using Edward Tufte’s English translation of the Napoleon’s March data visualization. From <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>, page 122-124.</p>
  <p><img src="img/napoleons-march.png" /></p>
  <p>One obstacle to creating elegant figures on the web is the difficulty of handling different screen sizes, especially on the fly. Embedded <code>iframe</code> elements are particularly troublesome. For these instances we provide a helper class, <code>iframe-wrapper</code>, the most common use for which is probably YouTube videos, e.g.</p>
  <pre><code>&lt;figure class=&quot;iframe-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YslQ2625TR4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>You can use this class on a <code>div</code> instead of a <code>figure</code>, with slightly different results but the same general effect. Experiment and choose depending on your application.</p>
  <h2 id="code">Code</h2>
  <p>Technical jargon, programming language terms, and code samples are denoted with the <code>code</code> class, as I’ve been using in this document to denote HTML. Code needs to be monospace for formatting purposes and to aid in code analysis, but it must maintain its readability. To those ends, Tufte CSS follows GitHub’s font selection, which shifts gracefully along the monospace spectrum from the elegant but rare Consolas all the way to good old reliable Courier.</p>
  <p>Extended code examples should live in a <code>code</code> element within a <code>pre</code> element. This adds control over indentation and overflow as well:</p>
  <pre><code>;; Some code examples in Clojure. This is a comment.

  ;; applying a function to every item in the collection
  (map tufte-css blog-posts)
  ;;;; if unfamiliar, see http://www.lispcast.com/annotated-map

  ;; side-effecty loop (unformatted, causing text overflow) - from https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/doseq
  (doseq [[[a b] [c d]] (map list (sorted-map :1 1 :2 2) (sorted-map :3 3 :4 4))] (prn (* b d)))

  ;; that same side-effecty loop, formatted
  (doseq [[[a b] [c d]] (map list
                             (sorted-map :1 1 :2 2)
                             (sorted-map :3 3 :4 4))]
    (prn (* b d)))

  <h2 id="imagequilts">ImageQuilts</h2>
  <p>Tufte CSS provides support for Edward Tufte and Adam Schwartz’s <a href="http://imagequilts.com/">ImageQuilts</a>. See the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003wk">ET forum announcement thread</a> for more on quilts. Some have ragged edges, others straight. Include these images just as you would any other <code>figure</code>.</p>
  <p>This is an ImageQuilt surveying Chinese calligraphy, placed in a full-width figure to accomodate its girth:</p>
  <p><img src="img/imagequilt-chinese-calligraphy.png" /></p>
  <p>Here is an ImageQuilt of 47 animal sounds over and over, in a figure constrained to the main text region. This quilt has ragged edges, but the image itself is of course still rectangular.</p>
  <p><img src="img/imagequilt-animal-sounds.png" /></p>
  <h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
  <p>Many thanks go to Edward Tufte for leading the way with his work. It is only through his kind and careful editing that this project accomplishes what it does. All errors of implementation are of course mine.</p>
