** What is the main problem this paper is trying to address **
This is a review of the current state of urban water modeling tools,understand the limitations of the existing tools, and present a path forward on how to address these limitations. 

Main Contributions:
1. Review of the existing eco-system of open-source tools for developing smart water systems
2. Identify the limitations and possibly identify the opportunuty cost of these limiations 
3. Chart a way forward on how we can address these issues.
