Pathways to enable the next generation of water systems. 

[What is this discussion about?]



[Digital Water Systems]
Water systems are one of the most critical elements in the urban infrastructure. 
Effeciently operating these systems is essential for ensuring that the residents have access to safe drinking water, preventing human and captial loss, and safe-guarding envrionment for the adverse effects of urbanization. 
Our existing urban water infrasturer is unable to keep pace with the increasing frequence of extreme weather events driven by climate change, aeging infrastructure, and rapid urbanization.
Though we can redesign and rebuild these infrastrure systems to meet these challenges, such reconstuctuion might not viable in most communities. 
Digital water systems are emerging as a viable alternative to concrete based solutios.


[What is the problem we are trying to solve?]

We will identify why we dont have a ditial water systems yet and identify the path ahead. 

Smart water research has often looked at the challenge of water in two ways, teachinal and social. I want to make a case both of these problemes are interliked and we can only solve by looking at these issues together. 
We need to involve stake-holders as a part of this discussion.


What are the issues we are facing
1. There is a lack of trust in the new technology
2. There is no clear concesus in the feild about what is smart water technology and where can it be applied
3. There is clear mis-match on who has access to these technologies?
4. What about security?
5. How can ensure that these systems are equitable?

I want to make a case that open-source and community dirven model is neceassry for addressing these challegens. 

Open-source infrasturyre has been instrumental in tech revolution. 
Open technoliges have enabled innovators to transition from start to end with litttle cost.
This has urshed in more development faster. 
Hence tools like numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib are incresinly becoming essenail in the operation of physical infrasture. 
Software librabries will become essentail, if there are not funded and goverend by the indudestry, there is a chance that an security issue related to any of this can collapse the systems. 
Hence, software tools should be considered as physical infrasture and have to be standardised. 
For example, EPA-SWMM is open source and is vetted by the US-EPA.
 This helps build trust and we know it is sustained maintenance from the US Govermnet, hence it is easy to build models and develop technoligies on top of it. 


There will be a merger of the phycisal and digial domian. If we do not have open technologies we stand the chance of create a divide between cities that can afford this tech and cities that cannot.


Threat to Cyber-Security is a significant issues. 


As we develop tools, there is no standard what security we have to follow. It is upto each company and utility to decide on the how the secutory they will use for their system. But this works fine as long as they have a good team. 
But if we dont, then what about it? Given the importance of these systems. We as a communoty should lead the disucssion. Similar to how IEEE etablishies wifi securty. We know when they say wep2a, how secure that it. 

Furethre more, if we can assure that these tools are managed by the communoty we can assure that software tools we are using to build our technolgies are secure. 


Esuring the equilty of these systems. 

How to evaluate these systems?

pystorms, that paper for van de wall dude. 

gregs paper, on how we can enure equitable development. 

pystorms

python foundtantion is an example.

Autonomoues vehiles are a standard. 

As we consider research, ensure the research remains accessble and equtable. 

Building an open technology
Open-Storm and Openwateranalysitics has been doing it. But it has been limited, we need to broabed insturion support like ICWMM. Ideally EWRI-ASCE and IWA could become venues for develiping such a teachlondy. 

There is a need to have best practices for we will operate our systems.
